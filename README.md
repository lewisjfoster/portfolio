## Versioning

Versioning and the CHANGELOG are handled by a GitHub action using [Conventional Changelog Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/conventional-changelog-action). [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) is in place to enforce conventional commit messages which are then used for versioning.
